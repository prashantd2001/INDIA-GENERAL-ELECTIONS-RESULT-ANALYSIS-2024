# INDIA-GENERAL-ELECTIONS-RESULT-ANALYSIS-2024
SQL PROJECT

## Project Overview
The **INDIA GENERAL ELECTIONS RESULT ANALYSIS 2024** project is a comprehensive analysis of the Indian General Election results for 2024. This project uses **SQL** to process, query, and derive insights from the election data, focusing on key trends, party performance, and voter behavior.

## Problem Statements
This project answers 15 key questions related to the election results:

1. **Total Seats:** What is the total number of seats available across the country?
2. **State-wise Total Seats:** What is the total number of seats available for elections in each state?
3. **NDA Total Seats:** How many seats were won by the NDA alliance?
4. **NDA Party Seats:** How many seats were won by each party in the NDA alliance?
5. **I.N.D.I.A. Total Seats:** How many seats were won by the I.N.D.I.A. alliance?
6. **I.N.D.I.A. Party Seats:** How many seats were won by each party in the I.N.D.I.A. alliance?
7. **Party Alliance Classification:** Add a new column in the `partywise_results` table to classify parties as **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A**, or **OTHER**.
8. **Winning Alliance:** Which party alliance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A, OTHER) won the most seats across all states?
9. **Winning Candidate Details:** Retrieve the winning candidate's name, party name, total votes, and the margin of victory for a specific state and constituency.
10. **EVM vs Postal Votes:** Analyze the distribution of EVM votes vs postal votes for candidates in a specific constituency.
11. **State-wise Party Wins:** Which parties won the most seats in a state, and how many seats did each party win?
12. **Alliance-wise State Seats:** What is the total number of seats won by each alliance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A, OTHER) in each state?
13. **Top Candidates by EVM Votes:** Identify the candidates with the highest number of EVM votes in each constituency (Top 10).
14. **Winners and Runners-Up:** Identify the winner and runner-up for each constituency in a given state.
15. **Maharashtra Insights:** For the state of Maharashtra, determine the total seats, total candidates, total parties, total votes (including EVM and postal votes), and a breakdown of EVM and postal votes.
